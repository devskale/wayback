<!--
        Use this template to start discussing about a new wanted feature.

        Although we recommend submitting MRs instead of feature requests, if 
        you have no programming experience or otherwise cannot do that you 
        can request it here and someone else may possibly work on it.

### Description

        Describe the feature you would like to have.

### Checklist

<!--
        If you are using a distribution package, please note that as development
        continues they may become out of date very quickly, and we ask you to
        see if the feature you need is present on the latest git revision.
-->

* [ ] I confirm that the feature I want is not on the latest git revision of 
      Wayback as of the time of reporting.

<!--
        We ask you to please check other feature requests to see if yours has 
        already been reported, to avoid duplicates.

        See <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayback/wayback/-/issues>
-->

* [ ] I checked the existing [feature requests][gl-feat] and confirmed this 
      is not a duplicate
